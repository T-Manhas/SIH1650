GLOFs Early Warning System

Background: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) occur when the dam containing a glacial lake fails, releasing large volumes of water suddenly and causing catastrophic downstream flooding. Climate change is increasing the number and size of glacial lakes, heightening the risk of GLOFs. Curent monitoring and prediction methods can be improved with advanced technologies like remote sensing, sensors installed near glacial lakes and machine learning. 

Description: The aim is to develop a remote sensing and/or sensor-based Early Warning System (EWS) for GLOFs by utilizing remote sensing data, network of IoT sensors and advanced data analytics. The system will continuously monitor and identify critical changes in lake size, water level, temperature, sudden water flow, dam stability and ground movement etc. around glacial lakes. The machine learning algorithms will analyse the information to detect early signs of potential outbursts. This approach will significantly enhance the capability to predict and respond to GLOFs, improving safety, reducing economic losses, and contributing to resilient infrastructure planning in glacial regions. 

Expected Solution: A Sensor which can be installed in glacial lake area, or a predictive model that significantly improves the Early Warning System ability for GLOFs, providing critical lead time for evacuation and mitigation efforts.
